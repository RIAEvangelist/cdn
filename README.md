# cdn
Digital Ocean CDN app for my npm modules that can be used in the browser, or to show coverage files more easily. The CDN is automatically updated with every commit of the modules that it is connected to, like a CI.

I will keep adding more of my opensource work into this app through the hooks in Digital Ocean. Check it out :
